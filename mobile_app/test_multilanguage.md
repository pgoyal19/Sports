### 4. Test Language Persistence

1. Select a language (e.g., Hindi)
2. Close the app completely
3. Reopen the app
4. Verify that the selected language is still active

## Expected Behavior

### English (Default)
- All text should be in English
- App name: "GoChamp"
- Welcome message: "Welcome to GoChamp"

### Hindi
- All text should be in Hindi
- App name: "‡§ó‡•ã‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™"
- Welcome message: "‡§ó‡•ã‡§ö‡•à‡§Ç‡§™ ‡§Æ‡•á‡§Ç ‡§Ü‡§™‡§ï‡§æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§ó‡§§ ‡§π‡•à"

### Bengali
- All text should be in Bengali
- App name: "‡¶ó‡ßã‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™"
- Welcome message: "‡¶ó‡ßã‡¶ö‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™‡ßá ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ó‡¶§‡¶Æ"

### Tamil
- All text should be in Tamil
- App name: "‡Æï‡Øã‡Æö‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øç"
- Welcome message: "‡Æï‡Øã‡Æö‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç‡Æ™‡Øç-‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡ØÅ ‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Æµ‡Øá‡Æ±‡Øç‡Æï‡Æø‡Æ±‡Øã‡ÆÆ‡Øç"

## Troubleshooting

### If translations don't appear:
1. Check that the translation files are in `assets/translations/`
2. Verify that `pubspec.yaml` includes the assets section
3. Run `flutter clean` and `flutter pub get`
4. Restart the app

### If language doesn't persist:
1. Check that `SharedPreferences` is working
2. Verify that the language service is properly initialized
3. Check for any error messages in the console

### If some text is not translated:
1. Check if the translation key exists in all language files
2. Verify that the key is being used correctly (e.g., `'key'.tr()`)
3. Make sure the key follows the nested structure (e.g., `'auth.welcome'`)

## Adding New Translations

To add a new translation:

1. Add the key to `assets/translations/en.json`:
```json
{
  "new_section": {
    "new_key": "English text"
  }
}
```

2. Add the same key to all other language files with appropriate translations

3. Use it in your widget:
```dart
Text('new_section.new_key'.tr())
```

- No performance impact on app functionality
- Translation files are loaded once at startup
- Memory usage is minimal
